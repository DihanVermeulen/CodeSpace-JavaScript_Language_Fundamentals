# CodeSpace - JavaScript Language Fundamentals

Welcome to the JavaScript Language Fundamentals module within the CodeSpace curriculum. Throughout this module, we've tackled a number of challenges, each housed within its own distinct folder. Within these folders, you'll find completed assignments that showcase our mastery of key concepts within the JavaScript language.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DihanVermeulen/CodeSpace-JavaScript_Language_Fundamentals
```

Go to the distinct challenge directory

```

Start the server by using [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) within VS Code extensions or if there is only a JavaScript file, then run
